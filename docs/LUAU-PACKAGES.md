# Local Luau package snapshots (foundation)

Local package discovery is implemented but **not yet connected to game startup**.
Place one package directory per identity under a chosen root, containing a UTF-8
`package.txt` and declared `.luau` files:

```text
format 1
package example
version 1.0.0
entry main
dependency arithmetic 1.2.0
module main scripts/main.luau
```

`ScriptWorker::execute_package` runs the entry from an immutable discovered
snapshot in a fresh, sandboxed Luau VM. Modules use `import("arithmetic:operations")`;
only their own modules and direct dependencies are visible. Errors name the
package/version/module. Sources and imports share one execution and memory
budget. Filesystem access happens only during bounded discovery, off the window
thread. See `src/server/script/package.rs` for exact syntax, bounds and Unix
path restrictions. This is not server delivery or a gameplay binding yet.
